            <h1>I Want to Work For You!</h1>

            <p>Hello. My name is Hildred Baker.  I'm a student at Code Kentucky.  In about 24 weeks, <br>I will have the skills and knowledge to be hired as a Junior Web Developer.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Currently, I am a Mail Carrier with the United States Postal Service.  Although this is a good job, I have alot of downtime in the Summer when mail and packages are lite.  I am not one to sit around and prefer to stay busy and even learn new things.  That's how I came across the Code Kentucky program, and I'm so glad that I did.  Not only am I learning a new skill, but I might actually be able to use this skill to make some extra income during my downtime.  A flexible schedule where I can work as directed from home sounds like the perfect job to me; especially since I spend most of my days outside fighting the elements -- and animals (like the vicious one pictured above).  In addition to my newly acquired coding skills, I am an experienced Administrative Assistant who has done just about everything from importing containers to filing payroll taxes.  I am good at working by myself or with a team and look forward to showing you what all I can do.</p>
